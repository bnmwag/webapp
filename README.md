# District

District is a platform where users can upload images generated by AI from Midjourney and then sell them to other users. Additionally, there is a Discord bot that interacts with the frontend and allows users to upload images directly from Discord after generating the AI image.

The web app is written in Next.js 13, while the Discord bot is written in Discord.js.

## Getting Started

To use District, you will need to create an account and sign in. Once you are signed in, you can upload images generated by AI from Midjourney and set a price for them. Other users can then purchase your images.

If you would like to use the Discord bot, you will need to add it to your Discord server. Once the bot is added, you can use commands to generate AI images and upload them directly to the District platform.
